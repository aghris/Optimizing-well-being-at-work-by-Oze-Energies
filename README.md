## Challenge context  
Well-being at work is characterized by the way employees express their satisfaction with respect to their thermal environment, 
air quality of their workplace or environmental noise during work days. This subjective perception of the environmental conditions,
such as feeling too warm or too cold for instance, has a tremendous impact on the health, the productivity and the well-being at work
of each individual. Designing a data driven algorithm which manages to predict individuals' comfort with respect to their workplace 
environment is pivotal to providing adapted tunings of building management systems (such as the set points of heating, ventilating, 
and air conditioning systems) so as to ensure and monitor the best comfort in the building.

## Challenge goals

This challenge proposes to develop machine learning based approaches so as to predict individuals' comfort model using several time series of environmental data obtained from sensors in a large building. The objective is to learn a classifier that uses these time series as inputs to predict the associated comfort class computed as an average of the comfort classes of all individuals in the building, assumed to experience the same environmental conditions.
